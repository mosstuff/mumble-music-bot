## Intentions
This project aims at createing a all-in-one Bot for a mumble server capable of playing music, enforcing acceptance of rules and other silly
 features.
## Current features
- Music playback using !play, !add and !stop commands 
> Note: Since YouTube started blocking Srver IP ranges from access without authentication, we opted to stream Music from a configured Jellyfin server and arbitrary URLs. We might add YouTube support in the future depending on if we need it ourselves.
- Enforce rules by deafening and muting new users until they !accept the provided rules
- Play custom intros for members that have been configured by the owner.

## Planned stuff
- Whatever we feel like
- Playlist support and Tagging for music
